    "#### 1. What is the concept of an abstract superclass?\n",
    "**Ans:** An abstract class/superclass can be considered as a blueprint for other classes. It allows you to create a set of methods that must be created within any child classes built from the abstract class. A class which contains one or more abstract methods is called an abstract class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas an abstract method is a method that has a declaration but does not have an implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, abstract superclasses are implemented using the abc module, which stands for Abstract Base Classes. The abc module provides the ABC class, which serves as a base class for defining abstract classes, and the abstractmethod decorator, which is used to declare abstract methods."

    "Similary a variable inside of a class also has a local variable scope. Variables which are defined in the class body (but outside all methods) are called as class level variables or class attributes. they can be referenced by there bare names within the same scope, but they can also be accessed from outside this scope if we use the attribute access operator `(.)`. on a class or an instance of the class."
