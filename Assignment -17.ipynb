    "#### Q1. Explain the difference between greedy and non-greedy syntax with visual terms in as few words as possible. What is the bare minimum effort required to transform a greedy pattern into a non-greedy one? What characters or characters can you introduce or change?\n",
    "**Ans:** The Main difference between Greedy and Non Greedy Match Syntax is The Greedy Match will try to match as many repetitions of the quantified pattern as possible Whereas The Non Greedy Match will try to match as few repetitions of the quantified pattern as possible"

    "#### Q2. When exactly does greedy versus non-greedy make a difference?  What if you're looking for a non-greedy match but the only one available is greedy?\n",
    "**Ans:** The Greedy Match will try to match as many repetitions of the quantified pattern as possible. The Non Greedy Match will try to match as few repetitions of the quantified pattern as possible. If only Non Greedy Match is available, we can use other filtering or pattern matching methods of regex and further identify the required pattern."

In contrast, **`re.search()`** will only return the first occurrence that matches the specified pattern. **`re.findall()`** will iterate over all the lines of the file and will return all non-overlapping matches of pattern in a single step."
